### Restarting after a delay

 * Finished the Coursera deeplearnign.ai spec some time ago: [completed courses](https://www.coursera.org/?skipBrowseRedirect=true&skipRecommendationsRedirect=true&tab=completed).
 It was much less challenging than the "Neural Networks for Machine Learning" course or even the "Machine Learning" course. But very interesting.

 * A new graphical card installed: **GeForce GTX 1060 6GB** and now with Python libraries installed using Conda [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).
 I finally have a working GPU setup where training a model is at least 30x faster than on CPU.
 
 * GPU 'top'-like tool: `nvidia-smi`
 
 
 
 

### Next steps

 - try more models,
 - try executing the learning on Colab (free GPU/CPU/TPU ;-))
 - hyper parameter search [https://github.com/autonomio/talos](https://github.com/autonomio/talos) , [https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/r2/hyperparameter_tuning_with_hparams](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/r2/hyperparameter_tuning_with_hparams)
 - analyze missclassified examples
 - deploy as a service
 - write a better-grid based manual classification tool
 - add "search last" and example number to the existing manual classification tool
